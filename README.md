R Studio Data Analysis - Analyzing Car Data to Create a Predictive Model for Car Prices

This project seeked to **successfully predict car market prices** using car specifications such as metrics like horsepower, wheel base, weight, etc.
To do this, I:
- Collaborated with a team to explore different modern regression models.
- Delivered the identification of the certain predictors that would be able to predict the car market prices

In this project, I tested various regression models, namely LASSO Regressions with k-fold Cross Validation.
I used metrics such as AIC, BIC, Cp Mallows relationships to define bias/variance tradeoff.
