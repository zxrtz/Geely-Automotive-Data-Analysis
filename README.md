R Studio Data Analysis - Analyzing Car Data to Create a Predictive Model for Car Prices

This project seeked to **successfully predict car market prices** using car specifications such as metrics like horsepower, wheel base, weight, etc.
To do this, I:
- Collaborated with a team to explore different modern regression models.
- Delivered the identification of the certain predictors that would be able to predict the car market prices
- Concluded that certain predictors like horsepower, body type (convertible, hatchback, etc.), and wheelbase (car width) are significant
As a result, **we fitted used a commonly known data science regression method**, and **achieved a predictive fit of 80% accuracy**.

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the project.

In this project, I tested various regression models, namely LASSO Regressions with k-fold Cross Validation.
I used metrics such as AIC, BIC, Cp Mallows relationships to define bias/variance tradeoff.
